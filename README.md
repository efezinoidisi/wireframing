# Wireframing

Wireframing is an important step in the design process, serving as the skeletal framework of a website, application or other digital product. User experience(UX) designers often use it to map out the design and layout of their work without going into too much detail. It is the first stage of the design process.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

1.  It allows designers and stakeholders to visualize the layout and structure of a
2.  It serves as a communication tool among team members, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the design and functionality.
3.  By focusing on the user interface structure, wireframing helps identify potential usability issues early on.
4.  Saves time and resources.
5.  Wireframes provide a clear and simple representation of the layout, allowing designers to plan the content placement and prioritize elements effectively.

## Key Elements Found in a Wireframe

- **Layout Structure**: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.

- **Navigation**: Shows how users will move through the site or application.

- **Content Placement**: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.

- **Functionality**: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

## Types of Wireframes

- **Low-fidelity wireframes**: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design. These help designers visualize how things work from a top-level perspective

- **High-fidelity wireframes**: This is a complete visual representation of the design. It is more detailed and refined, often closer to the final design, including more specific design elements.

### Example Figma design

- [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/E2BRqdPcKkrnX6hLGPto8Z/Project-Airbnb?node-id=1-2&t=sTAeZGS3VrBemZUd-0) : This is an example of a high-fidelity design. It shows all the complete details of the booking management system.

## Popular Wireframing tools

There are several wireframing tools available, most of which use the same underlying concepts.

## Benefits of Wireframing from a Software Development Perspective

- Clear path: It clarifies the direction and objectives of the site build and allows for better decision-making as to which web technologies, techniques and processes should be used in order to achieve an excellent result.

#### Real World Scenario where Wireframing Identified Potential Usability Issues before the development phase

**Educational Platform Dashboard**

- Wireframe Design:
  The dashboard featured a grid of course cards with no way to filter or sort them.

- Issue Identified:
  Testers with many enrolled courses struggled to find specific ones quickly, especially when the list was long.

- Solution:
  Added filters for course categories and a search bar to find courses by name or keywords.

Wireframing saves time and helps catch these issues before they turn into costly mistakes during development.
